JUREGEN

You are an outcast, convicted of a crime you may or may not have committed.
You have been sentenced to be taken to the deepest cave of the Earth, to the
foot of the Thousand Steps, and be flung into the Abyss.

The sentence is carried out, and you fall.

You fall for a timeless eternity, through Heaven and Hell, with the voices of
insanity shrieking at you from the darkness.  They taunt you with dreams of
torment and bliss, speaking fell prophecies and dire threats as the darkness
begins to consume your very soul.

At last you strike cold, unyielding rock.  You have fallen to the bottom of
the bottomless, beneath the waking world into the unknown catacombs of dreams.

You are lost and alone, helpless and blind in the dark.  Your friends and
family have forsaken you.  Your people have made your name anathama, and
erased your memory from their legends.  Your very gods shun you.

But you are still alive.

You must seek the Portal of Nightmares, master it, and bend it to your will.
The Portal of Dreams shall then take you to your final goal... whatever that 
may be.

QUEST IDEAS:
Slay lizard
Ant hive
Find someone's crystal ball that has been stolen.

Erm...  I guess that's the basis of ALL quests.



DUNGEON FEATURES:
Pools
Doors
Traps: They only appear on IMPORTANT things.
Mushroom patches
Altars
Vaults (Tough, locked rooms full of loot)


LOCATIONS:
In approximate order of depth:
*The Catacombs
The catacombs are the place you start out, the foot of the Thousand Stairs.
They are moderately large, and also relatively densely populated.  There are
probably a fair number of little things around here.  It's the starter
dungeon, sorta.
Probably 5 levels in all.

*Hermit's Hovel
A small, run-down shack.  You meet the Hermit here, who at least gives you a
bit of advice and a few handy items.

*Spider City
An entire town's worth of giant spiders.  This IS a town, and the spiders are
sentient, even if they remain terribly alien and probably rather hostile.

*Axis Mundi
There are many locations, but the main and largest location is the Axis Mundi,
the spindle upon which the world turns.  It takes the form of a whole smegload
of dungeon levels, each pierced in the center by a pillar (of some sort.
Gold?  Silver?  A tree?).  Most sub-locations are smaller, and branch off of
the Axis in one way or another.
If the Axis Mundi takes damage, it creates a magical wave that damages
everything around it (hm, ranged attacks...)
Probably 30-50 levels

*The Tomb
The tomb of some ancient warrior-king; this is as deep as people from the
surface normally go.  Or have ever gone, depending on who you ask.
There might be a whole longboat here.

*Mechtown
A bit like Spider City.  Automata galore.

*Mech Pit
I'm not quite sure yet whether this is a junkyard/graveyard, or a gladiatorial
arena.  It might be some of both.  Where the forgotten go to die.
3 levels

*Pillar of Light
If there's any safe haven, this is it.  You can rest here, and safely
stockpile items.  It is merely a room with a big shaft of light in the center,
and numerous alcoves along the sides.  It's probably accessible in several
different ways.
The altar to the Lady of Journeys is here.
1 level

*Dwarven Shrine

*Faerie Pool
This place will have a variety of different potential effects, all sorts of
things.
1 level

*The Fire Mountain -- Muspelheim
You might have to be fireproof to go here.

*White Temple
I have no idea.  Probably a quest involved some way or another.

*Hall of Mirrors
This... may just appear and dissapear in places at random.  There might be
useful items in it.  Like the Faerie Pool, all sorts of strange things might
happen here.

*Frost

*Bifrost
The Rainbow Bridge.  This will take you to the Well of Urd, perhaps.  You
might have trouble convincing Heimdal to let you pass.

*Cavern of Cats
More or less what it sounds like.  The Home of Cats.  You MIGHT find Krosp,
the Emperor of All Cats here.

*World Ocean
You might find Jormungand here.

*Shadow Realm

*The Brink
This is one level that is the border between the Axis Mundi, and the Pit.
Dunno quite what it'll be like yet.
1 level

*The Well of Urd
Secret.  You might find Norns here.  Convincing them to let you drink from the
well and gain Knowledge MIGHT be impossible.
1 level

*The Pit -- Ginnungagap
This is the bottom of the Axis Mundi, where the dragon Nidhoggr has
burrowed and wriggled around, leaving all sorts of erratic spaces.  It is
firey, poisonous, and intensely dangerous.
About 10 levels

*The End of the World
This is the last vestage of the waking world.  Beyond this, you're on your
own, and there is no turning back.

*Roots of the World Tree
Pretty much what it sounds like.  This is where you fight Nidhoggr.
Probably 3 levels, very interlinked.

*Dreams
Beneath the roots of the World Tree, you find the Portal of Nightmares.  How
you turn this into the Portal of Dreams, and what comes next, I don't know
yet.
One level.



STATS:
10 is "normal".  Cap depends on race; probably 20 default.
Stat buffs and debuffs are generally temporary
Strength
Speed
Toughness

Intelligence
Cleverness
Willpower

Power
Finesse
Resistance



RACES:
Human, elf, dark elf, dwarf, halfling, draconian, beastman, chaos/demon spawn,
celestian, orc, troll, lizardman, gnome, naga, ogre, minotaur, centaur,
ratling, catlin, barbarian, nomad...

That's 22.  Cut it down.  Say, 10 or something.
Can we make it... less tolkien-y?
Actually, I'm kinda okay with having a fair number.  There are lots of good
ideas out there.  I very very much like Crawl, because the races are very
distinct a lot of the time.  There isn't a lot to seperate high elves from
grey elves, or hill orcs from mountain dwarves, but there's nagas and merfolk
and draconians and demonspawn and oh my...

Human: Default
Elf: More frail and magic-y, light-inclined
Dark Elf: More frail and magic-y still, dark- and underground-inclined
Dwarf: Tough and underground-adapted.  
Draconian: Tough, they fly, are cold-blooded, and have a breath weapon

Orc: Ugly and mean and durable.  Can be decently smart.  Moderately underground-adapted 
Halfling: Charasmatic, dexterous,  
Demonspawn: Tough, magic-y, and dark-inclined.  Takes lots of exp.  Dig.
Celestial Bastard: Tough, magic-y, and light-inclined.  Takes lots of exp.  Wings.
Beastman: Tough, dexy, sneaky.



CLASSES:
It's okay if some of these are better than others.

*Goons: People who break things by hitting them.
Fighter: Flexible, tough
Archer: Ranged
Berzerker: Big offense
Bladedancer: Dual-wield, dexy
Assassin: Stealthy, sneak-attack, poison
Martial artist: Empty-handed

*Shinies: People who break things by thinking hard about it.
Wizard: Chaos/Sorcery
Priest: Light/Dark
Elementalist: Nature/Elemental
Psion: Mental/Physical
Alchemist: Any, makes items/potions/etc
Sage: Any, JOAT

*Confused: People who do both.
Mage-knight: Chaos/Sorcery
Paladin: Light/Dark
Druid: Nature/Elemental
Shifter: Mental/Physical, specializes in mental and teleportation effects
Summoner: All, specializes in summoning help.
Transformationist: All, specializes in combat enchantments.

*Skill-y: People who are good not-breaking things.
Rogue: Sneaks, steal, unlocks, etc.
Smith: Strong, tough, makes/improves/fixes things.
Woodsman: Survivalist
Bard: Charisma and wit galore.
Merchant: Buys low and sells high, knows much about items.
Tourist: Does everything badly.



INTRINSICS:
Nightvision
Resistance and immunity to various elements
See Magic
See Invisible (see that which cannot be seen?)
Magic Cancellation (a la The Dark Company)


X Resistance
Where X can be ice, fire, poison, death, magic...
It is not "you are immune", in the nethack sense.  But more "It does less to
you" in the Crawl/ADOM sense.  Death resistance will manifest as resistance to
necromantic magic, and a small chance of you not-dying when you take a lethal
blow.


ALIGNMENT:
It's good/evil, not the traditional law/chaos.  That's all an anerisian ruse.
There MAY be a law/chaos axis, but it'll be all neutral.
Okay, say that good-evil is -100 to 100, like luck.  -100 is Perfect Evil, and
100 is Perfect Good.  Now, which you end up being will affect the ending of
the game, strongly... what happens when you master the Portal of Nightmares.
If you're Modestly Evil or Modestly Good (5-90ish, say), you pass through it
and return to the surface, Champion of the Abyss, for better or for worse.
You have won, and you are free.
Now, if you're the Ultimate Good or Evil, then instead of passing through the
Portal of Dreams you become one with it, consume/are consumed by it, and are
the Force of Good or Evil.  If you're Ultimately Neutral, on the other hand,
you go right through it and out the other side as the Avatar of Balance, with
all the powers of both.
Or something.  I do have the distinct sense though, that the Balance result
should be the hardest and most potent ending.

Alignment also affects how deities will react to you.  Most deities are Good
or Evil; there are rather few Neutral ones.  The Norns might be one, though.

  people to your religion and build temples

(From the New Age nonsense(with all respect ofcourse))

  from evil/good creatures)
- Eat only food you've grown yourself (don't pick up any food in the dungeon,
  you don't know where it's been!)

  game (like soul and spirit)
- Don't use a mobile phone (or any other object that contains evil/good magic
  energy)


GODS:
You don't deliberately /have/ a deity, generally.
But you WILL run into small gods, who rule a little slice of the world...
rather small, slightly desperate beings who rule shakily over their little
domains.  Of course, some would be more powerful than others.
What you do for them, and what they want, might be interesting.  Useful and
troublesome, both.  You might even be able to kill them, thoretically.  Though
it'll be really hard, and may not involve physically attacking them.

Altars...  I dunno how they'll work.  Probably fairly similar to other
roguelikes.
If you destroy them, they'll be full of treasure, and you might get struck by
lightning.

Each god will have their good parts and bad parts.  I don't think that any
will be entirely without flaw or without merit.  I feel like they often
represent extremes, above all else.

Gods:
Lady of Journeys
Lady Death
Lord of Might
Lord of Decay (Lord of the Flies?)
Crusader
Annihilation
Muse and Wings of Light
The Holder of Secrets




LUCK:
Luck matters.  It'll probably be a small fudge factor in monster generation,
item drops, combat, spellcasting, learning...  It is a feature and a detail,
not a core part of gameplay.
Luck is a number between -100 and +100.  0 is average.

Improving luck:
Wait and it'll slowly increase toward 0
Pet a cat
Make gods happy
Carry (eat?) four-leaf clovers
Wield blessed items
Catch a Luck Virus

Abusing luck:
Breaking a mirror (lots more, in the hall of mirrors)
Piss off gods
Wait and it'll slowly decrease toward 0 (though more slowly than increasing)
Killing non-aggressive cats
Wield cursed items
Certain monster attacks may make you unlucky


SKILLS:
There are weapon skills and magic skills, as well as normal utility stuff.
These are important, and may well be one of the main ways one grows more
powerful.

Okay.  All skills range from 0 to 10.  There are no arbitrary skill caps.
However, there ARE learning bonuses.  A fighter is perfectly capable of
learning the biggest spell ever, but it'll take a fuckton of work.  A wizard
would do a lot better, since they've already put lots of effort into learning
magic.

Weapon skills:
Dagger
Sword
Club
Polearm
Axe
Unarmed

Bow
Thrown
Firearms

Magic skills:
Light
Dark
Elemental
Nature
Chaos
Sorcery
Mental
Physical


Other skills:
Armor
Shield
Two-handed weapons
Stealth
Digging
Flying (Anyone can learn, a la Douglas Adams, but it can be real hard)

Monster Lore?
Herbalism?
Fighting in general
Tactics
Magic lore
Intuition
Coup-de-grace/backstabbing






COMBAT:
You have two defensive stats, evasion and armor.  Armor is soak, evasion 
reduces the enemy's to-hit.

Wound penalties are not a good idea, in this case.

The four most relevant things are: Dodge value, armor value, hit bonus, and 
damage.
Dodge value = 5*(speed/2 + cleverness/4 + equipment)
Armor = toughness/4 + willpower/6 + equipment
To hit = 5*(speed/2 + cleverness/4 + equipment) + 50
Damage = strength/2 + intellegence/4 + equipment

This is a tad worrisome as it makes speed and cleverness more important, and
thus also dodge more advantagious than armor...

Hit and dodge are percentages.



FOOD:
I honestly haven't thought about this much, because I don't see it influencing
gameplay much.  There's a quite nice thread on rec.games.roguelike about the
various issues of food and what it implies and how it's used:
http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.development/browse_thread/thread/5afeb7ac25de48c5/64652849864d79b4#64652849864d79b4

It has several roles, it seems:
1) Food as resource management
2) Food as timer (keep going down or you starve)
3) Food as buff (Nethack intrinsics)

ADOM is more or less 1 and 3...  Mostly 1 as time goes on, since you can buy a
berjillion fried lizards and stomafilia and not worry too much about food from
then on.
Crawl is very much 1 and 2, with more 2.  Chunks rot fast and safe-to-eat
chunks are not always readily avaliable, and there is no reliable source of
food like ADOM.  There IS no 3, which is interesting, and makes intrinsics
both less important and a lot harder to get.

Hunger will probably happen, more or less in the traditional vein.  Getting
hungry probably won't happen THAT fast, but...  It might actually be
interesting to go without entirely and see how it works out.



ITEMS:
Charms: 
Instead of wands and scrolls, we have charms.  Charms are objects imbued
with magical power, with their own store of magic points.  They have one
or possibly more spells attached to them, and use these spells with their
own magic points.  Once these magic points are gone, the charm is generally
useless; however, there are certain things that can refill a charm's power.
Additionally, some very rare charms draw magic from their surroundings,
and thus recharge themselves naturally.

Skilled alchemists and weaponsmiths may be able to do other things with 
charms, such as:
Add and remove power points from them, destroy them to unleash all the power
in a destructive wave, destroy them safely and siphon the excess magic from
them, modify them, decompose them into magical reagents, 

There are also non-artifact magical items, item-affixes, etc.
Winged dagger, boomstick, Wand of Striking, traditional
flame/frost/lightning/thunder (electricity vs. percussive damage), Good or
Evil, favored by a particular deity...


Slots: Head, neck, body, cloak, wrists, gloves, left/right finger, boots, 
left/right hand, missile weapon, ammo, light source, 

Ditch wrists?
Do we want ADOM-style or Crawl-style inventories?  They actually show very
different assumptions in game design; in ADOM, you WILL be wearing boots (and
eventually Seven League Boots) while in Crawl, you can go through perfectly
good games and not find any boots at all.  Crawl is actually very interesting,
in the design goal that Nothing Is Necessary and There Is No Best Item.

ARTIFACTS
Artifacts are special items, weapons, or whatever, that have powerful
properties.  They are very rare, having been made by the gods themselves.
Just how they work and what they do has yet to be decided, but they will
probably be indestructable among other things.

MAGIC:
There are eight realms of magic, in four opposing pairs.
Light/Dark
Chaos/Sorcery
Nature/Elemental
Mental/Physical

  L
 M|N
C-*-S
 E|P
  D

Anyone can potentially learn any magic.  However, spellcasters tend to 
specialize in certain types; most choose a primary domain, in which their 
casting abilities are more powerful, and they are more skilled at learning 
that type.  So a Chaos Wizard could learn Mental magic, but wouldn't be as 
good at it as at Chaos.
They can also elect to choose no domain, in which case they're moderately good 
at everything, and somewhat better than average in both their class's preferred 
domains.  So said Generalist Wizard would be slightly better at everything than 
the Chaos Wizard, and while the Chaos Wizard WOULD be kickass at breaking 
stuff, they'd probably be suckiest at Sorcery.

How the hell do you learn spells?  Just books?  I guess so.
Alternatives: Learn them intrinsically and somewhat randomly (meditate, and a
spell pops out), get given them via gods or items (occasionally)...  How you
play the game might also affect what spell you get (a la El Goonish Shive,
though I was really thinking of Iji's nano-thingamajigs)


Chaos specialized:
C: 10, S: 4, everything else 5
Unspecialized:
C: 8, S: 8, everything else 6

Much more specialization?  Yeah.
Chaos specialized:
C: 10, S: 6, everything else 2
Unspecialized:
C: 8, S: 8, everything else 2


Do spells increase with the power of the caster?  Makes sense.
Is this based on level?  Stats?  Skills?  Spell-skill?
Level and skills I think, with stats helping.

Now...  HOW the hell do you learn spells???

Then we just have various thresholds (control and self-preservation come to
mind) that judge when to switch from one state to another.

There should be other states: Asleep, allied, confused, stunned...

Do they talk to each other and learn resistances?  Do they share ammo?  Do
they alert each other?  What kind of pathfinding do they do?
