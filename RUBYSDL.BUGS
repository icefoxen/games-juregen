Documentation:
"SDL::Surface#fillRect(x,y,w,h)
SDL::Surface#fill_rect(x,y,w,h)
This function performs a fast fill of the given rectangle with color."
This doesn't mention the secret 5th argument where you specify the color.

Having documented key constants would be nice.

Why is SDL::Event.enableUNICODE all in capital letters?
