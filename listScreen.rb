# This is a class that will draw and do the gui input for a screen displaying
# arbitrary text.  You give it a bunch of lines, and it displays them,
# handling page-up and page-down if necessary.  Z and Escape will go back.
#
# It's a tad iffy, 'cause it's going to have its own little mainloop
#
# I need arrow keys.
